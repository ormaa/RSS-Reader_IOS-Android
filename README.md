# RSS-Reader_IOS-Android

April 03 2018 :
This project is a proof of concept allowing me to validate, or not, if I can use Xamarin forms technology to create IOS application, and android Application in "same" time."

it shoud delivrer a RSS reader : a simple reader, hte application itself is not really important.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

I started this project on the 3rd April 2018.
I have worked during few days before that, reading and making some tries with xamarin forms.

I have to admit that there is a lot of issue, but for the moment, it is really amzing that I have one simple application, in the same develomment state, for 2 targets : IOS and android.


NOTE :
I suggest that you wait my aknowledge before geting the code, or making a fork :o)
I will put some comment in this read me when you could get the code, or do a fork
this advice just because I will commit several fix or update during the few next days....

Enjoy
Olivier
