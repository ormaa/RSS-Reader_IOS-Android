# RSS-Reader_IOS-Android

Starting project : April 03 2018 :
This project is a proof of concept allowing me to validate, or not, if I can use Xamarin forms technology to create IOS application, and android Application in "same" time."

it shoud delivrer a RSS reader : a simple reader, hte application itself is not really important.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

I started this project on the 3rd April 2018.
I have worked during few days before that, reading and making some tries with xamarin forms.

I have to admit that there is a lot of issue, but for the moment, it is really amzing that I have one simple application, in the same develomment state, for 2 targets : IOS and android.

5th April 2018 :
At this step , it is working as I was expecting.
a simple RSS reader, using an hard coded URL, displaying thumbnail, title, and description + a web page content, when user click on an article.

it took me 1.5 days (I had an update for around 4 hours, during the 2 last days)

for me, it is nice to have the 2 version in "same" time.
but 1.5 days for a simple RSS reader seem to be almost long for me.
I don't know really well xamarin forms, and all things we can do between main applicationb, and dedicated project depending on each platform, but I know well C#.
to give a comparison, I wrote the same thing in Swift 4.1, in 0.5 day !
using Kotlin, which is similar in syntax compared to swift (it help I think) could be fast also : I don't have tested that way yet !

Anyway, the job done by Microsoft is just huge, and the project confirm me that when you want to just write an application, for 2 device, without having a knowledge of each platform language, Xamarin forms can be a solution, especially fi your application do not need specific controls, or large amount of processing.

Enjoy
